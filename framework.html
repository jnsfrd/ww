  <details>
    <summary>
      Why should we choose your FL framework over other options?
    </summary>
    <p>
      <small>
        Our framework offers an easy-to-use interface, visual aids, and collaboration tools for ML/FL projects, with features like distributed tracing and event logging for debugging and performance analysis. It ensures security through client identity management and authentication, and has scalable architecture with multiple servers and load-balancers. FEDn also allows flexible experimentation, session management, and deployment on any cloud or on-premises infrastructure.

    <summary>What deployment options does FEDn offer?</summary>
    <p>
      <small>
        FEDn offers two main deployment options to cater to different organizational needs and project stages. The fully-managed SaaS (Software as a Service) model simplifies access to federated learning technology, making it ideal for early-stage projects, pilots, and proof-of-value phases. For organizations with strict cybersecurity requirements, FEDn can be deployed on private clouds or on-premise, providing full control over deployment, security, and privacy. This self-managed option is particularly suitable for advanced security needs, such as protecting IP-sensitive ML models.
      </small>
    </p>
