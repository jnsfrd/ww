              <p> In intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance, large amounts of data is gathered through sensors. AI challenge Edge processing poses significant challenges, in some cases due to the limited bandwidth and in some cases due to the amount of data generated. </p>
              <p> Federated learning improves data quality and model accuracy by training models directly where data is generated, reducing the need to transmit sensitive or large data. It enables model training on diverse, locally processed data, addressing data scarcity challenges and optimizing AI training at the source. </p>

              <p> AI models can learn to recognize complex patterns and anomalies that may indicate a cyber intrusion. AI Challenge Involves analyzing heterogeneous and high-volume data streams. Challenging because: Of the complexity and variability of network traffic Difficult to keep confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information while using it to train AI models Federated learning Federated learning can enhance intrusion detection by: Learning from diverse data sources across various network segments without centralizing sensitive data Processing data locally, which is crucial for adhering to privacy regulations and safeguarding sensitive information </p>
